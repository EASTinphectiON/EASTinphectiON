  As well as building software, APIs and plugins

  Have been devoting hours towards learning How to Code

- 💞️ I’m looking to Collaborate on Everything.
  Whether the be for your project or mine. I've got
  An NDA we will both go over and Sign. We will even

  I, and WE Value Intellectual Property.

  to MY Repositories and I solely own the Rights,
  Patent,Trademark, Copyright, Industrial Design etc.
  even copied or Cloned without my concent as I am 
  learning how this "Formal" Coding Contribution and
  Public Display of Source Code Wowks. Every Pull Request,
  Issues and or Names are changes or contributions by
  Myself, Others of GitHub, Personal, Enterprise or 
  Organization; As well as, any other Person or
  Cmpany/Organization on the Planet will not be able

  Brand or Offer our Codes, Names, Respositories,
  Pull Requests, Issues, Contributions or 
  comments/plans on my works or other work as 
  carried out with my IP.. weither that from my
  Descriptions, RoadMaps Repositories, Names,
  Contributions etc with a goal of producing
  some of the "Next BIG Things" and citing everyone
  Who contributes, whether I cloned your code 
  and/or wrote my own. Anything I do on Here, GitHub
  and/or on Social media falls under copyright laws
  And I will not lose IP rights due to "Public Disclose;"
  As I want to be Fully Transparent to those following 
  Me Here or on Social Media. Including those who
  stumble across me, my businesses, my products,
  services or idea and understand the Value of a White
  Paper (seeing as all of not most cryptocurrency
  Projects have one. Maybe Companies/Corporations to
  as this may be a Quartly or Year end Review or 
  Discolusre. At which I am in the process of Issuing 
  Formal Variations of these Documents instead of
  Social Media, Website or Community Claims, For I 
  understand the benefits of a "Private Project" vs
  an "OpenSource" and in reality I need hundreds 
  of Contributors. I am willing to cite you and
  accredit you for anything you or I do in regards 
  to My Code or Yours (including non related 
  softwares, apps, websites, code, blockchain etc)
  Basically Any and All Developments I'm involved in
  Whether I contributed to yours in some way or
  another or Put a Road Map Out the for  the Word
  To develop. As I am 1 in a Billion or should I say 
  1 in Currently 10 Billion Roughly and my Apps, 
  ideas and software are to. If they can come to
  Light anywhere it's Here. On GitHub

👉 For More info or to Get Involved

- 📫 the BEST way to Reach me is by Email

  Gather the appropriate things or people to 
  bring it all together in a COAXISABLE manor.
  AS transparent and a clean peice of Glass with
  Not a Speck of Dirt or Dust and or even a
  section or snippet of smudged code because I
  GitHub down with everything and see things a
  Little differently than most.

  Very Business Oriented and have always been
  Focused on creating Financial Freedom for 
  Myself and Others and Truly Live up to My
  Companies Slogans. One of which from

  to include you; and if you Would like to
  Contribute and/or Use anything that I've posted
  That is Public or Private or GitHub or Online.
  I will consider It so long as you AGREE and 
  Bind yourself to Me and the Project by signing
  A non disclosure agreement. Otherwise known

  Get a Head Start and Complete NDA Here
  --->

  Your to send a Brief Message/Memo so don't
  be shy. State your code of interest, how you'd
  Like to contribute (whether you can or just
  have and idea or something worth considering)
  As this only Streamlines our Conversation and 
  In turn brings value to our Discussions and
  This is your Chance to Establish a connection
  or leverage something as these took me years 
  to develop, release and fine tune.
  Everything was down with my Own Blood, Sweat,
  Tears and Equity. Not one Idea, Product or
  Service was Hijacked or Stolen from Someone 
  Else. These are all mine, Easton Bodeux's. 
  Everything including original and all 
  variations are my PopCultureIP. I'd gladly
  Lease them to you if ALL these "parameters"
  as stated here and in NDA's are Met.
  Those of You that do not abide, Now 
  or in the future will not be granted access
  and will be Prosecuted to the fullest extent
  of the Law in both my Region or Yours.
  Even when your Caught Attempting to Rip
  It off or Clone without my Concent.
  One may wonder why they are Public but 
  they have to be. Given the times we live 
  In as I am a from believe that any and 
  all data whether that be typed or spoken,
  Is Sifted by a program/bot. Where it is
  filtered for context and sent to the 
  appropriate person/department thanks to 
  Social Media and Community Standards, 
  Which sure do break it down Word for Word
  And take that idea since Meta and other
  Patent Pooling Clubs/Organizations do.
  Including Scoop up your video context
  because you can see just how quickly
  subtitles are generated or how a Post 
  can immediately be taken down or ranked
  further in the newsfeed along with your 
  other posts right after posting. Like 
  seconds. As I'm sure I will find out 
  with my own applications as nothing 
  is safe anymore. Besides maybe a Self 
  Hosted Server that is protected, 
  secure and encrypted in more ways then
  one. Call me stupid or Paranoid if u 
  want. One just has to uses common 
  sense to see that they probably monitor
  anything self hosted or not. The moment
  It's out there's it's linked to a IP
  and Mac Address. Sold to China or Out 
  of Country where society thinks it's 
  okay to then not credit that individual
  or corporate identity / organization.
  Like if they don't already do this on the 
  DL there stupid as this cracks down on
  illegal activity for one and any harmful 
  act on social media and depending on 
  the situation I could Garuntee a report
  going to say authority figures or the 
  development team at Facebook or Google 
  per say which will then pop up as a new
  tech start up or corporation as I've 
  already seen this happen throughout
  the year and even have had accounts 
  get banned and taken over including 
  Gmail's. Trust me I thought my phone
  was TAP'D because within a few months
  These "ideas" or "products" became a
  thing. Shortly after posting and
  getting banned on social media 
  platforms because my post and or 
  posts didn't follow community 
  standards, while they aren't going
  against it. They were and are always 
  Professional. No matter what I do.
  My thoughts are They would just say 
  anything they could prior and after 
  it's flagged and once it is, it
  probably goes into stage #2 where 
  it's looked into a little bit more 
  closely. Maybe by a human but also a
  botwhere it's like, K why did this 
  get flagged, Then highlights and 
  pulls examples into snippets and 
  determine how serious is the matter. 
  And what is it, an Invention worth 
  Patenting or authority figures worth 
  calling because someone is threatening
  society or something so sinister. 
  Maybe even going viral with political
  Or intellectual subject matter.

  I'm sure you can imagine and 
  understand my skepticism with posting 
  to github and not developing these in
  a secret bunker...So don't call me
  Crazy or Start an Intellectual
  Property Scandal and do the right 
  thing and support or contribute to 
  My Project(s) instead.

  Thanks,


  I Hope to Hear from You or Your
  Company/Organization soon and will be 
  awaiting your Inboxes, Stars, and Help

  As I'm always Waiting to Connect.

  💪😎👍
